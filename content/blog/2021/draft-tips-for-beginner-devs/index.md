# intro

As a beginner developer it might be frustrating when you try to get an exercise or task done and the process just don't flow as easily as you would like to.

Many things might come to mind when you start the task:
- how do you start writing a function? 
- what do I do if I get stuck?
- is there a methodology for doing it?

The answer to these questions might differ from person to person, however there are general steps you can take that will ease the process, an algorithm for writting problem solving.

## why do you need a methodology?

## methodology

- understand what do you want to achieve

### come up with a draft function
- clarify input / output data types
- test along the way

### test it

## improve your draft function
- DRY
- does the method/function fits to screen without scrolling?
- code defensively 
- validate the input type, what can go wrong there?


## ask for a review (if possible)
